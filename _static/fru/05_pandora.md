After the cutscene, Pandora quickly opens with her first mechanic.

## Fulgent Blade

The boss will cast *Fulgent Blade*, which starts with raid-wide damage. The 
boss will also autoattack during this sequence (before casting to cast *Akh 
Morn*).

Pandora's autoattacks hit the **top two** players with hate (which should be 
both tanks).

After the *Akh Morn*, Pandora goes straight into the next mechanic.

## Paradise Regained - Team DN

This is the most complex mechanic of the phase.

The strategy below closely resembles Team DN's method, which positions the first
tower completely safe from the first cleave, making it slightly more involved
for tanks, but simpler for the rest of the party.

The only difference is that instead of the melee and ranged take the last two
towers, we split the DPS left and right based on their left/right groups
instead.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>12.</b> Find the first tower. Use this tower as <b>South</b>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT:</b> Rotate to the new "North".</li>
        <li><b>H1, H2:</b> Preposition in the first tower.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/05/paradise_regained_01.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" width="50%">
      <p><b>13.</b> The second tower appears.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the boss will cast <em>Wings Dark and Light</em>, and 
      one of the boss's wings will glow.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT + ST:</b> Tank swap during the <em>Wings Dark and Light</em> 
        cast.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The MT goes top-left or top-right (around the same height as the
      second tower), depending on which wing glows first.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Light (Left) wing glows:</b> MT goes top-right.</li>
        <li><b>Dark (Right) wing glows:</b> MT goes top-left.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A tether will also appear, which needs to go to the ST. It
      <em>cannot</em> be passed around, but instead automatically tethers to 
      either the nearest or furthest player <b>that is not the player with
      aggro</b> (depending on the wing).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Light (Left) wing glows:</b> ST needs to be the furthest.</li>

The boss then goes into its final mechanic of the loop.

## Polarizing Strikes

This is the simplest mechanic of the phase, consisting of four rounds of stack 
damage.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>18.</b> Make two lines SW and SE with the tanks in front.</p>
      <p>The boss will fire a Light-aspected line AoE at the line on the left, 
      and a Dark-aspected line AoE at the line on the right.</p>
      <p>Both line AoEs will leave behind a residual AoE that explodes again 
      shortly.</p>
      <p>The player in front of each line (which should be the tanks) will also
      get a <em>Light Resistance Down</em> or a <em>Dark Resistance Down</em> 
      debuff (depending on which line hit them).</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/05/polarizing_strikes_01.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>19.</b> After the line AoEs go off, return to the two lines SW and
      SE.</p>
      <p>However, because the first player in each line got a <em>Light 
      Resistance Down</em> and <em>Dark Resistance Down</em> debuff, they
      cannot rejoin their previous line.</p>
      <p>As a result, <b>the two people that were in front of the line before
      needs to switch sides.</b></p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>20.</b> The process then repeats for a total of four times, with a 
      different player at the front of the line instead.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tanks > Melee > Ranged > Healers</li>
      </ul>

After this, Pandora casts *Pandora's Box*, which is a Tank LB3 check.

From there, the mechanics repeat from *Fulgent Blade*. At the end of the second
loop, Pandora casts *Paradise Lost* for enrage instead of *Pandora's Box*.

Sometime during *Paradise Lost*, Ryne will exclaim *"You can weather this! I
know you can!"* and give you 1.5 bars worth of Limit Break, which should reach
an LB3. When she does so, *immediately* LB3 (or it will not resolve before the enrage).

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Fulgent Blade]</b> One group can't make it to the other side of the boss
  in time for Akh Morn!
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Check how the tank is dodging the exalines.</p>
      <p>The more the tank dodges towards the side of the diamond where the
      exalines originated from (the area marked red), the more the boss
      is turned when it starts to cast <em>Akh Morn</em> and its orientation
      locked.</p>
      <p>The more the boss is turned, the harder it is for the light party to
      make it to the other side of the boss in time.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> this is particularly pronounced when the tank does the
      "uptime" dodge, because it encourages them to dodge to that side of the
      diamond.</p>
