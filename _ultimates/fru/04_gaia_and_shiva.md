The Usurper of Frost will respawn at either North or South, whichever is
further from where The Oracle of Darkness was defeated.

### Fragment of Fate

The Usurper of Frost casts *Materialization*, which spawns the Fragment of Fate North.

Over the course of the phase, the Fragment of Fate will take damage. Assuming no player hits it with an AoE, it will survive
with barely any HP.

This means that if it takes *any* extra damage (e.g: from a player's AoE, or a
poorly aimed *Spirit Taker*), the phase becomes impossible to clear (although
you'll still be able to get practice in.)

The Oracle of Darkness then respawns (everyone should swap over to target her) 
and the two bosses begin their first mechanic.

## Darklit Dragonsong

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Two sets of debuffs come out:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Two tank/healers and two DPS each get <em>Refulgent Chain</em>

        <li>Two random players get <em>Dark Water III</em>.</li>

To resolve the tethers, we have to make a "bowtie" shape- this is the same as
how *Light Rampant* was solved in *Eden's Verse- Refulgence*.

With the tethers sorted out, the next thing we need to do is separate the two
*Dark Water III* debuffs.

The two bosses then target whoever has their hate with a 4-hit *Akh Morn*, 
followed by another *Morn Afah*, which is a party stack.

*Morn Afah* is also a boss HP check, and the two bosses must be within 5% HP of
each other, or *Morn Afah* will be lethal.

## Crystallize Time - fast pop

This is probably the hardest part of the encounter, so hang in there.

Six hourglasses will spawn this time, and the Oracle of Darkness will tether:

- The North and South hourglasses with yellow tethers.
- Two of the remaining opposite hourglasses with purple tethers.

The party will also get a bunch of debuffs to resolve.

The two bosses will reappear around the center of the arena and immediately 
start another 4-hit *Akh Morn* into *Morn Afah* sequence (where the two bosses 
have to be within 5% HP of each other).

Both bosses will then start casting their respective enrages (*Absolute Zero*
and *Memory's End*).

When both bosses are defeated, you will advance to the next arena. If the
Fragment of Fate is not around, Eden's Promise will spawn and wipe the raid.
If, on the other hand, the Fragment of Fate is still alive, then the party 
advances to the final phase.
