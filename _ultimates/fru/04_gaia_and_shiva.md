# Gaia and Shiva (WIP)

The Usurper of Frost will respawn at either North or South, whichever is
further from where The Oracle of Darkness was defeated.

The Fragment of Fate then spawns North. The Fragment of Fate will take damage
throughout the phase. Assuming no player hits it with an AoE, it will survive
with barely any HP.

This means that if it takes *any* extra damage (e.g: from a player's AoE, or a
poorly aimed *Spirit Taker*), the phase becomes impossible to clear (although
you'll still be able to get practice in.)

The two bosses then target whoever has their hate with *Akh Morns*, followed by
another *Morn Afah*, which is also a 5% HP check.

## Crystallize Time

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

*Akh Morns*, followed by another *Morn Afah*.

When both bosses are defeated, you will advance to the next arena. If the
Fragment of Fate is not around, Eden's Promise will spawn and wipe the raid
instead.
