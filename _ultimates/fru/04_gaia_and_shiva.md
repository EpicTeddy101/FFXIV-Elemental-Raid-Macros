# Gaia and Shiva (WIP)

The Usurper of Frost will respawn at either North or South, whichever is
further from where The Oracle of Darkness was defeated.

The Fragment of Fate then spawns North. The Fragment of Fate will take damage
throughout the phase. Assuming no player hits it with an AoE, it will survive
with barely any HP.

This means that if it takes *any* extra damage (e.g: from a player's AoE, or a
poorly aimed *Spirit Taker*), the phase becomes impossible to clear (although
you'll still be able to get practice in.)

  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Two sets of debuffs come out:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Two tank/healers and two DPS each get <em>Refulgent Chain</em>
        tethers.</li>
        <li>Two random players get <em>Dark Water III</em>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>One player will have <em>both</em> tethers <em>and</em> Water.</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

To resolve the tethers, we have to make a "bowtie" shape- this is the same as
how *Light Rampant* was solved in *Eden's Verse- Refulgence*.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>2.</b> This is the best case scenario, where the tethers already
      make a bowtie.</p>
      <p>No adjustments are needed.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>If the tethers make a box, then two players need to swap positions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <b>west-most</b> tank/healer tether.</li>
        <li>The <b>west-most</b> DPS tether.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>(These two players should be tethered together.)</em></p>

      swap positions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <b>west-most</b> tank/healer tether.</li>
        <li>The <b>east-most</b> DPS tether.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>(These two players should be tethered together.)</em></p>
      <p>Alternatively, the entire party can also rotate 90 degrees clockwise.</p>

With the tethers sorted out, the next thing we need to do is separate the two
*Dark Water III* debuffs.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>3.</b> If the two <em>Dark Water III</em> debuffs are on different 
      sides, then no further adjustments need to be made.</p>
      <p>If both <em>Dark Water III</em> debuffs are on either the 
      tank/healers or the DPS, then <em>everybody</em> who is not tethered
      swaps side.</p>
      <p><em>(In this example, since both healers have Water, all the 
      non-tethered players swaps side.)</em></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/04/darklit_03.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>4.</b> The tethered players take the two towers, while the Usurper
      of Light readies <em>The Path of Light</em>, which cleaves the four
      closest players- these should be the four non-tethered players.</p>

  <tr>

      <em>Spirit Taker</em>.</p>
      <p>Spread out for this, and remember to spread out <em>away</em> from the
      Fragment of Fate!</p>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>6.</b> The Usurper of Frost will then use <em>Hallowed Wings</em>,
      which will cleave either the West or East half of the arena.</p>
      <p>The <em>Water III</em> debuffs will also resolve roughly at the same
      time, so stack up on the safe half of the arena.</p>

      <em>Somber Dance</em>, which should be the tank with aggro.</p>
      <p>The two tanks swap places.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>9.</b> This is followed up by <em>Somber Dance's</em> second hit,
      which targets the nearest player. This should be the other tank.</p>
      <p><b>If the tank is not a PLD</b>, this can be simplified by invulning
      and having the same tank take both hits instead.</p>

The two bosses then target whoever has their hate with *Akh Morns*, followed by
another *Morn Afah*, which is also a 5% HP check.

## Crystallize Time

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

*Akh Morns*, followed by another *Morn Afah*.

When both bosses are defeated, you will advance to the next arena. If the
Fragment of Fate is not around, Eden's Promise will spawn and wipe the raid
instead.
