# Pandora (WIP)

After the cutscene, Pandora quickly opens with her first mechanic.

## Fulgent Blade

The boss will cast *Fulgent Blade*, which starts with raid-wide damage. The 
boss will also autoattack during this sequence (before casting to cast *Akh 
Morn*).

Pandora's autoattacks hit the **top two** players with hate (which should be 
both tanks).

## Paradise Regained

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

## Polarizing Strikes

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

After this, Pandora casts *Pandora's Box*, which is a Tank LB3 check.

From there, the mechanics repeat from *Fulgent Blade*. At the end of the second
loop, Pandora casts *Paradise Lost* for enrage instead of *Pandora's Box*.

Sometime during this, Ryne will exclaim *"You can weather this! I know you
can!"* and give you 1.5 bars worth of Limit Break, which should reach an LB3.
When she does so, *immediately* LB3 (or it will not resolve before the enrage).

Ryne and Gaia will both exclaim *"Yaaaaaargh!"* if the LB3 will finish the job
(it deals about 2.5% of the boss's max HP in damage) for a cinematic finish.
