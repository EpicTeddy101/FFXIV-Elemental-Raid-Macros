# Pandora (WIP)

After the cutscene, Pandora quickly opens with her first mechanic.

## Fulgent Blade

The boss will cast *Fulgent Blade*, which starts with raid-wide damage. The 
boss will also autoattack during this sequence (before casting to cast *Akh 
Morn*).

Pandora's autoattacks hit the **top two** players with hate (which should be 
both tanks).

After the *Akh Morn*, Pandora goes straight into the next mechanic.

## Paradise Regained

This is the most complex mechanic of the phase. The strategy below follows 
[Nukemaru's recommendation](https://youtu.be/nzpOdfOyUNo?si=5Jiyv8DZCmnXi1Oq&t=190).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>12.</b> Find the first tower. Use this tower as <b>South</b>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT:</b> Rotate to the new "North".</li>
        <li><b>H1, H2:</b> Preposition in the first tower.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/05/paradise_regained_01.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" width="50%">
      <p><b>13.</b> The second tower appears.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the boss will cast <em>Wings Dark and Light</em>, and 
      one of the boss's wings will glow.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT + ST:</b> Tank swap during the <em>Wings Dark and Light</em> 
        cast.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The healers adjust within their tower, while the DPS moves East or
      West, whichever side is safe.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Light (Left) wing glows:</b> Move to the right side of the boss.</li>
        <li><b>Dark (Right) wing glows:</b> Move to the left side of the boss.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A tether will also appear, which needs to go to the ST. It
      <em>cannot</em> be passed around, but instead automatically tethers to 
      either the nearest or furthest player <b>that is not the player with
      aggro</b> (depending on the wing).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Light (Left) wing glows:</b> ST needs to be the furthest.</li>
        <li><b>Dark (Right) wing glows:</b> ST needs to be the nearest.</li>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <p><b>14.</b> The third tower appears and the other wing glows.</p>
      <p>DPS can preposition in the second or third tower, whichever is safe

The boss then goes into its final mechanic of the loop.

## Polarizing Strikes

This is the simplest mechanic of the phase, consisting of four rounds of stack 
damage.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>18.</b> Make two lines SW and SE with the tanks in front.</p>
      <p>The boss will fire a Light-aspected line AoE at the line on the left, 
      and a Dark-aspected line AoE at the line on the right.</p>
      <p>Both line AoEs will leave behind a residual AoE that explodes again 
      shortly.</p>
      <p>The player in front of each line (which should be the tanks) will also
      get a <em>Light Resistance Down</em> or a <em>Dark Resistance Down</em> 
      debuff (depending on which line hit them).</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/05/polarizing_strikes_01.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>19.</b> After the line AoEs go off, return to the two lines SW and
      SE.</p>
      <p>However, because the first player in each line got a <em>Light 
      Resistance Down</em> and <em>Dark Resistance Down</em> debuff, they
      cannot rejoin their previous line.</p>
      <p>As a result, <b>the two people that were in front of the line before
      needs to switch sides.</b></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/05/polarizing_strikes_02.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>20.</b> The process then repeats for a total of four times, with a 
      different player at the front of the line instead.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tanks > Melee > Ranged > Healers</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/05/polarizing_strikes_03.jpg">

After this, Pandora casts *Pandora's Box*, which is a Tank LB3 check.

From there, the mechanics repeat from *Fulgent Blade*. At the end of the second
loop, Pandora casts *Paradise Lost* for enrage instead of *Pandora's Box*.

Sometime during this, Ryne will exclaim *"You can weather this! I know you
can!"* and give you 1.5 bars worth of Limit Break, which should reach an LB3.
When she does so, *immediately* LB3 (or it will not resolve before the enrage).
