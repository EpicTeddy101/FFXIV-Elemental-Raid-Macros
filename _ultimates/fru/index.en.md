# Futures Rewritten (Ultimate)

Elemental's FRU PF strat is currently a **work in progress**.

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<ul>
  <li><b>I will be using this page to take notes and help communicate with my 
  static- the strat is not finalized and is subject to change.</b></li>
  <li><b>This will be a time-intensive process- things likely won't settle down
  until the end of Patch 7.1 (roughly March/April 2025).</b></li>
</ul>
</div>

### BiS Notes

- Use your **i730** BiS.
- Relic weapons (when they arrive) will have their substats capped at **393**.
- Use the highest grade potions available.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Strategy]</b> How will the strategy evolve over time?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>In the beginning, we will likely follow or at least be close to what 
      Mana does because of interest <em>(many players will travel to Mana to 
      get extra prog in PF)</em>.</p>
      <p>However, there will come a point where PF runs into a wall and gets 
      "stuck"- at this point on, Elemental's strategy typically diverges from 
      Mana.</p>
      <p>While <em>it would be nice</em> if Elemental followed Mana all the way
      to the end, Elemental's Ultimate PF culture is, well, ultimately <em>(pun
      not intended)</em> stronger than Mana's.</p>
      <p>While it is in Elemental's interest to accommodate Mana's strategy, 
      Elemental is not as beholden to follow Mana unlike other raid content 
      (like EX trials).</p>
      <p>As a result, the final strat will likely resemble Mana in the first 
      few phases, but differ towards the end.</p>

      <p>The Damage Down debuff in this phase lowers a player's damage by
      <b>90%</b>.</p>
