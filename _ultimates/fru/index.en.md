# Futures Rewritten (Ultimate)

Elemental's FRU PF strat is currently a **work in progress**.

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<ul>
  <li><b>In the interest of getting a working strat documented, I have decided
  to document Lucrezia's strat.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Lucrezia actually has multiple groups- although Lucrezia has 
      released video guides and Idyllshire has a written guide, I will instead 
      start by referencing what their <em>streaming team</em> does, as the 
      video and written guides do not have sufficient detail.</li>
      <li>As a result, this <em>may</em> have some differences from the 
      "Lucrezia" strat done on Mana.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>For now, the focus is on getting something written down
  <em>without</em> having to debate the merits of each strategy.</b></li>
  <li><b>Once more groups have cleared and we have more information, some 
  things will likely be modified- again, the focus is to get <em>something</em>
  workable first.</b></li>
  <li><b>This will be a time-intensive process- a final strategy likely won't 
  come until the end of Patch 7.1 (roughly March/April 2025).</b></li>
</ul>
</div>

### BiS Notes

- Use your **i730** BiS.
- Relic weapons (when they arrive) will have their substats capped at **393**.
- Use the highest grade potions available.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Damage Down]</b> How strong is the damage down debuff in this fight?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>There are actually <em>two</em> different Damage Down debuffs in this 
      encounter, both of which lowers a player's damage by <b>90%</b>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One comes from getting hit by avoidable attacks.</li>
        <li>One comes from resolving stacks with fewer people.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because these damage downs come from two separate debuffs, <em>they
      stack</em> together for a combined <b>99% damage down!</b></p>
