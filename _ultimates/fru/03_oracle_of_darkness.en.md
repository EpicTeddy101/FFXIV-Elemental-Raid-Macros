# Oracle of Darkness

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p style="text-align:center"><b>This documents Lucrezia's strategy- it is not 
expected to be the final strategy used.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Lucrezia actually has multiple groups- although Lucrezia has 
  released video guides and Idyllshire has a written guide, I will instead 
  start by referencing what their <em>streaming team</em> does, as the 
  video and written guides do not have sufficient detail, and I need to 
  check how mechanics are resolved over multiple pulls.</li>
  <li>As a result, this <em>may</em> have some differences from the "Lucrezia" 
  strat done on Mana.</li>
</ul>

until I have better first-hand experience.</b></p>

The Oracle of Darkness starts south, and immediately opens with *Hell's Judgment*, which sets everyone to 1HP.

She will then teleport to the middle of the arena and prepare her first
major mechanic with a heavy raid-wide.

## Ultimate Relativity

## Apocalypse

The boss casts *Memory's End* as the enrage, and must be brought down to under 20.0% HP to survive the cast.
