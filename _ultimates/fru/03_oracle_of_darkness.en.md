# Oracle of Darkness

The Oracle of Darkness starts south, and immediately opens with *Hell's Judgment*, which sets everyone to 1HP.

She will then teleport to the middle of the arena and prepare her first
major mechanic with a heavy raid-wide.

## Ultimate Relativity - Atobe

This writeup illustrates the <a href="https://twitter.com/PoneKoni/status/1862335851671560669">"Atobe" strat</a> that Nukemaru's group uses.

When *Ultimate Relativity* resolves, there will be a lot of debuffs that go 
out. However, you only need to check a limited set of debuffs.

Six of the eight sets of debuffs have fixed assignments:

- Two DPS will get 10s Fire debuffs (the "short Fires").
- One tank/healer and one DPS will get 20s Fire debuffs (the "mid Fires"). 
  They will also need to take note of their 42s debuff:
  - One will have a 42s *Dark Water III* debuff.
  - The other will have a 42s *Dark Eruption* debuff.
- Two tanks/healers will get 30s Fire debuffs (the "long Fires").

This leaves the last tank/healer and the last DPS. One of them will get a *Dark Blizzard III* debuff, and the other will get a *Dark Fire III* debuff.

- **If the Blizzard is on a DPS:** This will be a "slow Blizzard". The tank/
  healer will get a 10s Fire debuff and join the "short Fire" group.
- **If the Blizzard is on a tank/healer:** This will be a "fast Blizzard". The 
  DPS will get a 30s Fire debuff and join the "long Fire group.

We then resolve the debuffs. Each debuff group moves in and out between the 
center of the arena and their hourglass according to what they need to resolve.

After you gain control of your characters, stack up in the middle to share a 
*Shell Crusher* AoE. The hourglasses will disappear, and the boss casts a 
raid-wide *Shockwave Pulsar*. The boss will then target the first player in 
aggro with *Black Halo*, a two-player tankbuster cleave.

## Apocalypse

The boss will be targetable for the duration of this mechanic.

Before the cast, the Oracle of Darkness first casts *Spell-in-Waiting Refrain* 
which puts three pairs of *Dark Water III* on six different players to be 
resolved during *Apocalypse*.

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

The boss casts *Memory's End* as the enrage, and must be brought down to under 
20.0% HP to survive the cast.
