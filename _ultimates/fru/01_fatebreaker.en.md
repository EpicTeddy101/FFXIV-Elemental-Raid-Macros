# Fatebreaker

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p style="text-align:center"><b>This documents Lucrezia's strategy- it is not 
expected to be the final strategy used.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Lucrezia actually has multiple groups- although Lucrezia has 
  released video guides and Idyllshire has a written guide, I will instead 
  start by referencing what their <em>streaming team</em> does, as the 
  video and written guides do not have sufficient detail, and I need to 
  check how mechanics are resolved over multiple pulls.</li>
  <li>As a result, this <em>may</em> have some differences from the "Lucrezia" 
  strat done on Mana.</li>

## Cyclonic Break

Fatebreaker opens with *Cyclonic Break*, which is a mechanic that reappears 
shortly in the middle of *Utopian Sky*.

The boss will return to the arena with *Burnished Glory*, a heavy-hitting 
raid-wide that also applies a DoT on the party.

Shortly after, the boss then prepares the second mechanic combo.

After this, the boss begins to cast a *Burnished Glory* as the hard enrage for 
the phase.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Strategy]</b> Are there any differences from Lucrezia's strategy?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>There are a couple minor differences.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The spread positions towards the beginning of <em>Utopian Sky</em>
        has been changed to match Elemental's strategy for <em>Dragonsong's
        Reprise</em>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Front:</b> Healer (Elemental) vs Melee (Lucrezia)</li>
            <li><b>Left:</b> Melee (Elemental) vs Tank (Lucrezia)</li>
            <li><b>Center:</b> Tank (Elemental) vs Healer (Lucrezia)</li>
            <li><b>Right:</b> Ranged</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The way to assign players to towers is slightly different. Here,
        I've assigned three players to towers (H1, D4, H2), and have three
        players flex like <em>Wyrmsbreath 2</em> in <em>Dragonsong's
        Reprise</em>. Lucrezia fixes H1 to the North tower, and H2 to the
        south tower, but has all four DPS fill in the missing pips from North
        to South in order from D1 to D4.</li>
      </ol>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Utopian Sky]</b> Why shouldn't you jump if your sector is safe?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>When the party is spread out, everybody is looking for movement as an 
      indicator that "this sector is not safe", since one of the conditions is
      that <em>if the player opposite you moves</em>, then your sector is not 
      safe either.</p>
      <p>As a result, if you jump up and down to try and indicate that your
      sector is safe, it will likely get <em>misinterpreted</em> as "this 
      sector is <em>unsafe</em>" instead.</p>
