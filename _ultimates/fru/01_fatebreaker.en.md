## Cyclonic Break

This is a base mechanic that reappears in the middle of *Utopian Sky*.

## Utopian Sky

The boss will then cast *Utopian Sky* and glow either red or blue. **Pay 
attention to this colour.**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>5.</b> Take up your spread positions for <em>Utopian Sky</em>.</p>

        <li>The MT and ST are slightly in towards the middle, but not so far in

        <p style="text-align:center"><b>N.B:</b> These spread positions may change.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Three clones will raise their gunblade to telegraph that they will 
      fire a line AoE down the middle at the same time the <em>Powder Mark 
      Trail</em> on the MT resolves..</p>
      <p>This will leave two safe sectors opposite one another.</p>
      <p>However, because they are only visible to nearby players, the party
      will need to signal to one another which clones are firing.</p>
      <p>The way to do this is to move in towards the center of the arena if 
      either:</p>

        <li>The player directly opposite you moves in.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>(Do not do </em>anything<em> (no jumping, etc.) if neither of 
      the above is true.)</em></p>
      <p>Done correctly, there should be six people moving, and two people 
      opposite one another standing still.</p>

      <p>The boss also does a <em>Burnt Strike</em> (Lightning) from 
      east-to-west.</p>
      <p>In addition, two random players will get targeted with a <em>Prey</em>
      marker and a <em>Fated Burn Mark</em> debuff (this will wipe the party if
      the player dies.).</p>
      <p>The party needs to split into two groups of four, which we do
      tanks/healers vs DPS:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>North:</b> Tanks + healers</li>
        <li><b>South:</b> DPS</li>

The boss will return to the arena with *Burnished Glory*, a heavy-hitting 
raid-wide that also applies a DoT on the party.

Shortly after, the boss then prepares the second mechanic combo.

## Fall of Faith

This is a strat I'd like to try out for now, because while most groups are
resolving this with a "conga line" system, I think it's quite messy
(especially in PF)! Instead, I'd like to try a role-based system instead.

## Towers

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

After the towers, the boss casts a *Burnished Glory* as the hard enrage for 
the phase.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Utopian Sky]</b> Why shouldn't you jump if your sector is safe?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>When the party is spread out, everybody is looking for movement as an 
      indicator that "this sector is not safe", since one of the conditions is
      that <em>if the player opposite you moves</em>, then your sector is not 
      safe either.</p>
      <p>As a result, if you jump up and down to try and indicate that your
      sector is safe, it will likely get <em>misinterpreted</em> as "this 
      sector is <em>unsafe</em>" instead.</p>
      <p>Thus, if your sector is safe, <b>stand still and do not move</b>.</p>
