## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Utopian Sky]</b> Why shouldn't you jump if your sector is safe?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>When the party is spread out, everybody is looking for movement as an 
      indicator that "this sector is not safe", since one of the conditions is
      that <em>if the player opposite you moves</em>, then your sector is not 
      safe either.</p>
      <p>As a result, if you jump up and down to try and indicate that your
      sector is safe, it will likely get <em>misinterpreted</em> as "this 
      sector is <em>unsafe</em>" instead.</p>
      <p>Thus, if your sector is safe, <b>stand still and do not move</b>.</p>
    </td>
