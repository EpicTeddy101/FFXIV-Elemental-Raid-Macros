# Usurper of Frost

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p style="text-align:center"><b>This documents Lucrezia's strategy- it is not 
expected to be the final strategy used.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Lucrezia actually has multiple groups- although Lucrezia has 
  released video guides and Idyllshire has a written guide, I will instead 
  start by referencing what their <em>streaming team</em> does, as the 
  video and written guides do not have sufficient detail, and I need to 
  check how mechanics are resolved over multiple pulls.</li>
  <li>As a result, this <em>may</em> have some differences from the "Lucrezia"

The boss opens the fight with *Quadruple Slap* on the player with most hate
(which should be the MT).

Despite the name, this is actually a "two-hit" tankbuster, but the first hit
applies a *Physical Vulnerability Up* debuff that *can* be Esuna'ed.

The boss then teleports slightly south of center and casts *Mirror Image*
which summons an (untargetable) Oracle's Reflection before casting *Diamond
Dust* for heavy raid-wide damage.

## Diamond Dust

*Diamond Dust* resolves itself in a very similar way to *Diamond Frost* in
Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage). Lucrezia resolves this in a relative-North
fashion:

The Usurper of Frost reappears back in the center of the arena and casts 
*Hallowed Ray* on the party (which is a heavy-hitting line stack) before 
starting the next set of mechanics.

## Mirror, Mirror

The Usurper of Frost will be targetable during this mechanic.

Two red mirrors and one blue mirror appear at the edge on any of the eight
cardinal/intercardinal positions.

- Blue mirrors copy the Usurper of Frost's attack, resolving at *the same
  time*.
- Red mirrors copy the Usurper of Frost's attack, but *resolves later*.

- The two red mirrors always spawn 90 degrees from one another.

A few seconds later, the boss will start to cast *Absolute Zero*. This will
serve as the hard enrage, *unless* the boss is brought under 20.0% HP.

If the DPS check is met, *Absolute Zero* will be a raid-wide and a knockback
instead, so stay near the middle.

      <p>Note that even after the Crystals of Light have been destroyed, the

Once the four Crystals of Light have been destroyed, all party members should
destroy the Ice Veil.

If all four Crystals of Darkness are still alive, Gaia will gain enough power
*("My power surges!)* to deal 50.0% damage to the Ice Veil just before *Endless
Ice Age* resolves. As a result, the damage check is to get the Ice Veil below
50.0% HP.

  <b>[Strategy]</b> Are there any differences from Lucrezia's strategy?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>There are a couple clarifications.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Lucrezia had the DPS on the sides instead of in the center
        during <em>Mirror, Mirror</em>. It's flipped here to let the
        healers focus on healing.</li>
        <li>Lucrezia also didn't have a strict spread assignments during 
        <em>Mirror, Mirror</em>, adjusting on the fly as needed.</li>

</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The two stacks are always tethered together.</p>
      <p>Because connected players alternate between North and South, this
      results in one stack North, and one stack South.</p>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Diamond Dust]</b> Any tips for aiming my slide on a controller during <em>Twin Silence/Stillness</em>?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>For context, this is a problem specific to playing on a controller.</p>
      <p>Keyboards don't have this problem because pressing "W" moves your
      character perfectly forward. On a controller, pushing the analogue 
      stick forward will not be perfect, so that slight deviation may be 
      enough to get you killed.</p>
      <p>Something that might help would be to set up a macro like so:</p>
      <pre>/automove on
/automove off</pre>
      <p>This will make your character take one tiny step directly forward 
      where your camera is facing.</p>
