# Usurper of Frost

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p style="text-align:center"><b>This documents Lucrezia's strategy- it is not 
expected to be the final strategy used.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Although Lucrezia has released video guides and Idyllshire has a
  written guide, I will instead be referencing what they do <em>on
  stream</em> as the guides have some notable differences, and are missing
  information.</li>

The boss opens the fight with *Quadruple Slap* on the player with most hate
(which should be the MT).

Despite the name, this is actually a "two-hit" tankbuster, but the first hit
applies a *Physical Vulnerability Up* debuff that *can* be Esuna'ed.

The boss then teleports slightly south of center and casts *Mirror Image*
which summons an (untargetable) Oracle's Reflection before casting *Diamond
Dust* for heavy raid-wide damage.

## Diamond Dust

*Diamond Dust* resolves itself in a very similar way to *Diamond Frost* in Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage). Lucrezia resolves this in a relative-North fashion:

      (inter)cardinal.</p>
      <p>The first circle starting from (True) North and going clockwise will
      be "North" for this mechanic.</p>
      <p>Either the tanks/healers or the DPS will be selected to drop AoEs.</p>

        <li><b>Scythe Kick:</b> <em>("Cleave!")</em>: Donut AoE.</li>

      <p>The kick will also fire a cone AoE towards the four closest players, 
      which should be baited by the players <em>not</em> dropping AoEs.</p>
      <p>Another tell that you can use is that the Oracle's Reflection will 
      face South if she's doing <em>Axe Kick</em>, but North if she's doing 
      <em>Scythe Kick</em>.</p>

The Usurper of Frost reappears back in the center of the arena and casts 
*Hallowed Ray* on the party (which is a heavy-hitting line stack) before 
starting the next set of mechanics.

## Mirror, Mirror

The Usurper of Frost will be targetable during this mechanic.

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

## Light Rampant

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

*Absolute Zero* is the enrage. If the boss is brought to below 20% HP, this will not be lethal, although it still needs to be mitigated.

Stay middle because it's a small knockback.
