# Usurper of Frost v2.0

This is version 2.0, that's based off the Google Doc with two options for Light
Rampant.

The boss opens the fight with *Quadruple Slap* on the player with most hate
(which should be the MT).

Despite the name, this is actually a "two-hit" tankbuster, but the first hit
applies a *Physical Vulnerability Up* debuff that *can* be Esuna'ed.

The boss then teleports slightly south of center and casts *Mirror Image*
which summons an (untargetable) Oracle's Reflection before casting *Diamond
Dust* for heavy raid-wide damage.

## Diamond Dust - Colour-coded

*Diamond Dust* resolves itself in a very similar way to *Diamond Frost* in
Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage). We resolve this using the colour-coded
markers.

## Sunbound Holy

The Oracle's Reflection then casts *Sunbound Holy*, which targets each healer 
four times with a 4-man stack AoE that also leaves a puddle behind. Each party 
needs to drop these puddles and end up **either directly behind the boss**, or 
**at least 135 degrees away from the boss**.

First, let's address the "cursed" pattern, which is where the boss teleports 
directly in front of either light party.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>With the "cursed pattern", move as soon as the star AoEs go off. The 
      aim is to <b>not</b> drop the first <em>Akh Morn</em> puddle directly 
      behind the boss (marked in yellow).</p>
      <p>After that, quickly run clockwise 180 degrees around the arena- you 
      need to drop four puddles and still make it to the other side.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/02/diamond_dust_07d.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

With that out of the way, there are two methods to resolving the non-cursed 
scenarios:

### Sunbound Holy - Always Away

While the rule of "always rotate away from the boss" does not always result in 
the party ending up directly opposite the boss, the movement is a consistent 90 
degree turn.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>If the boss is 90 degrees from a party, both parties rotate away from 
      the boss and end up directly opposite.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/02/diamond_dust_aa_07a.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>If the boss is 45 degrees from a party, both parties rotate away from 
      the boss and end up 135 degrees away from the boss.</p>
      <p>The next movement will be slanted.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/02/diamond_dust_aa_07b.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Sunbound Holy - CW priority

Alternatively, if you prefer ending up directly in front or behind the boss, 
then you can opt to rotate clockwise in 2/3 of the remaining cases (and 
anti-clockwise in the last case).

Depending on where the boss is, you can run further if needed to better 
position yourself directly behind or opposite the boss.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>If the boss is 90 degrees from a party, both parties rotate 90 degrees clockwise.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/02/diamond_dust_07a.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>If the boss is 45 degrees anti-clockwise from a party, then both 
      parties rotate at least 90 degrees clockwise, and can rotate an 
      additional 45 degrees if they want to put them directly behind the boss.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/02/diamond_dust_07b.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>If the boss is 45 degrees clockwise from a party, then this is the only scenario where the parties run anti-clockwise.</p>
      <p>Both parties rotate at least 90 degrees anti-clockwise, and can 
      rotate an additional 45 degrees if they want to put them directly behind 
      the boss.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/02/diamond_dust_07c.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

We need the two parties to be behind or at least 135 degrees away from the 
Oracle's Reflection to prepare for the next mechanic.

  </tr>
</table>

The Usurper of Frost reappears back in the center of the arena and casts 
*Hallowed Ray* on the party (which is a heavy-hitting line stack) before 
starting the next set of mechanics.

## Mirror, Mirror

The Usurper of Frost will be targetable during this mechanic.

Two red mirrors and one blue mirror appear at the edge on any of the eight
cardinal/intercardinal positions.

- Blue mirrors copy the Usurper of Frost's attack, resolving at *the same
  time*.
- Red mirrors copy the Usurper of Frost's attack, but *resolves later*.

- The two red mirrors always spawn 90 degrees from one another.

After this, the boss will teleport to the middle and begin another signature 
mechanic.

## Light Rampant

Two players at random will be selected to drop AoE puddles, while the other six
will get tethered together *(Chains of Everlasting Light)*.

- After 10 seconds, the *Chains of Everlasting Light* debuff will turn into 
  *Curse of Everlasting Light*. From this point on, the raid wipes if the 
  tethers get too short.

There will also be six stacks of *Lightsteeped* randomly distributed among the 
party (although no player can start with more than two stacks).

- Resolving mechanics or getting hit by an AoE increase the stacks of 
  *Lightsteeped* by one.
- The raid wipes if any player reaches 5 stacks of *Lightsteeped*.

There are two main ways to resolve *Light Rampant*.

### Light Rampant - 4:4

This is essentially a mirrored version of the strategy outlined in the Google 
Doc, with tanks and melee on the West instead of the East.

The main difference is that instead of rotating players in a fixed direction to 
make the hexagon, we count CW/CCW from MT/D1 instead. This effectively makes the 
party rotate clockwise or anti-clockwise depending on whether two tank/healers 
or two DPS get puddles.

This is equivalent to having H2 or D4 swap over to the other side (depending on 
whether both puddles are on two DPS or two tanks/healers.)

### Light Rampant - ZizieZip

This is a different method to assigning towers, which is equally viable. The 
party is more spaced out at the start, making it easier to identify the puddle 
players.

A few seconds later, the boss will start to cast *Absolute Zero*. This will
serve as the hard enrage, *unless* the boss is brought under 20.0% HP.

If the DPS check is met, *Absolute Zero* will be a raid-wide and a knockback
instead, so stay near the middle.

## Endless Ice Age

This is the mini "transition" phase.

Once the four Crystals of Light have been destroyed, all party members should
destroy the Ice Veil.

If all four Crystals of Darkness are still alive, Gaia will gain enough power
*("My power surges!)* to deal 50.0% damage to the Ice Veil just before *Endless
Ice Age* resolves. As a result, the damage check is to get the Ice Veil below
50.0% HP.

      <p>There are a couple clarifications.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Lucrezia had the DPS on the sides instead of in the center
        during <em>Mirror, Mirror</em>. It's flipped here to let the
        healers focus on healing.</li>
        <li>Lucrezia also didn't have a strict spread assignments during

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The two stacks are always tethered together.</p>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Diamond Dust]</b> Any tips for aiming my slide on a controller during <em>Twin Silence/Stillness</em>?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>For context, this is a problem specific to playing on a controller.</p>
      <p>Keyboards don't have this problem because pressing "W" moves your
      character perfectly forward. On a controller, pushing the analogue 
      stick forward will not be perfect, so that slight deviation may be 
      enough to get you killed.</p>
      <p>Something that might help would be to set up a macro like so:</p>
      <pre>/automove on
/automove off</pre>
      <p>This will make your character take one tiny step directly forward 
      where your camera is facing.</p>
