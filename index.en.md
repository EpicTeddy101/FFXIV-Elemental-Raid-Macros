# FFXIV Elemental Raid Macros

This repository is a collection of my notes for Ultimate strategies encountered in
the Elemental and Mana Data Centers (DC).

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p><b>NEW URL:</b> <a href="https://xivjpraids.com/">XIV JP Raids</a></p>
<p><b>Why?</b> Those who have been around the Discord might know that I've been
wanting to rebrand things for some time now.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since DC travel became a thing, I haven't been PF'ing in Elemental.</li>
  <li>I also cannot cover <em>all</em> forms of raid content by myself (note
  the lack of Criterion, or Chaotic Alliance Raid coverage)</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting with Patch 7.2, I've decided to move the resources over to 
<a href="https://xivjpraids.com/">XIV JP Raids</a>. The EX and Savage resources
here will get moved over, leaving this site just to host the (non-FRU) Ultimate
guides, since PF seems to have associated those strats with me.</p>
<p>Moving forward, this site will be used for more personal content (e.g: for
my statics), and not necessarily reflect what PF does.</p>
